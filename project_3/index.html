            Guys better don't bring up this topic. You're young, playful, everything's easy for you. It's wrong. <br>
            It's not Chikatilo, and not even FBI archives. Better don't venture here. I'm serious, any of you would regret. <br>
            Better close the topic and forget everything written here. I quite understand this message provokes more interest, but I want to warn the curious - stop. The rest will just be lost.
